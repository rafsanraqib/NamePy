# NamePy
Simple website created using JavaScript, HTML and CSS which predicts the gender of a person according to their name

Logic:
The Javascript code running in the backend takes in the input from the user using HTML forms. The user input is then investigated 
to determine whether the name is of a male or female. This is not a 100% accurate judgement. The app.js file contains the javascript
logic, prac.html file contains the HTML code and the style.css contains the css code. 

How to run:
//For windows
Open up powershell or if you are using Atom then install platform-ide-terminal package and press alt+shift+t to open up a terminal
inside atom. Change the directory and then type Invoke-Expression .\prac.html, which will open the webpage. Enter a name and watch 
the magic unfold!. 

//For mac
Open the terminal and type open prac.html. This will open up the webpage. Type any name in the text field and see the magic!
